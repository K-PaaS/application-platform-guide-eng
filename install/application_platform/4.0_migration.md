# <div id='1'/>1.  Document Outline

## <div id='2'/>1.1.  Purpose
This document (installation guide) is for upgrading pasta from version 3.1 or lower to version 4.0.

## <div id='3'/>1.2.  Range
This document (installation guide) guides you on how to upgrade pasta from version 3.1 or lower to version 4.0.


# <div id='4'/>2. Paasta 4.0 version upgrade
In Paasta 4.0, the distribution method and version upgrade method changed with versions prior to 3.1. Until Paasta 3.1, the version was upgraded based on the CF-release. However, with cf-release 287, cloud-foundry's bosh and cf deployment methods have changed.
Bosh distributed bosh based on bosh-deployment, and cloud-foundry distributed cf based on cf-deployment. Cli also changed from bosh-cli1 to bosh-cli2. In Bosch-cli2, the existing Bosch-cli command was also changed.

For this reason, upgrading from paasta-3.1 to 4.0 is not possible with the existing method. The purpose of this guide is to migrate existing apps and user/organization information when upgrading from paasta-3.1 to 4.0.

In order to migrate to Paasta 4.0, ccdb, uaadb, and blobstore data must be bakcuped and restored.

![PaaSTa_Migration_Image]


## <div id='5'/>2.1.	pre-requsite

1.	There should be no user using paasta during Backup and Restore.
2.	3.1 and 4.0 shall have the same System domain.
3.	cf_admin_password must be the same as version 3.1.
4.	The Value in db_encryption_key at Paasta-3.1 Paasta-controller.yml should be the same when installing paasta-4.0. 
5.	The Paasta-3.1 Backup standard is bosh1 and the Paasta-4.0 recovery boshcli standard is bosh2.


### <div id='6'/>2.2.	paasta-3.1 backup

Back up database data and blobstore data on the installed vm of paasta-3.1


### <div id='7'/>2.2.1.	ccdb, uaadb backup (bosh cli 1 based)

```
$ bosh ssh postgres_z1/0   #postgres database vm access
$ sudo su –
$ cd /var/vcap/packages/postgres_x.x.x/bin/
$ ./pg_dump -U ccadmin -p 5524 -d ccdb --data-only --column-inserts > /tmp/ccdb-data.sql     # ccdb database backup (user, organizaion, spacae, app meta data)
./pg_dump -U uaaadmin -p 5524 -d uaadb --data-only --column-inserts > /tmp/uaadb-data.sql    # uaadb database backup (User Information meta data)

$ exit
$ exit   # comes from postgres vm.

$ bosh scp postgres_z1/0 --download  /tmp/ccdb-data.sql  {download_path}
$ bosh scp postgres_z1/0 --download  /tmp/uaadb-data.sql  {download_path}
$ cd {download_path}
$ mv ccdb-data.sql.postgres_z1.0 ccdb-data.sql
$ mv uaadb-data.sql.postgres_z1.0 uaadb-data.sql

```
### <div id='8'/>2.2.2.	blobstore backup

```
$ bosh ssh blobstore_z1/0   #blobstore_z1 vm Access
$ sudo su -
$ cd /var/vcap/store  
$ sudo tar cvf blobstore.tar shared/
$ sudo mv blobstore.tar /tmp/

$ exit
$ exit   # comes from blobstore vm

$ bosh scp blobstore_z1/0 /tmp/blobstore.tar {download_path} –download  (Time consuming depending on app capacity)

$ mv blobstore.tar.blobstore_z1.o blobstore.tar
```

### <div id='9'/>2.2.3.	ccdb, uaadb datafile edit


1)	Open uaadb-data.sql File
Delete Sentence : identity_zone, identity_provider, schema_migrations Table insert

2)	Open ccdb-data.sql File
Delete Sentence : schema_migrations Table insert



## <div id='10'/>2.3.	paasta-4.0 restore (bosh2 cli Based)

### <div id='11'/>2.3.1.	pre-requisite

-	The bosch cli used in recover is bosch2
-	paasta-4.0 should have been installed.
-	The system domain must be the same as before.
-	Cf_admin_password must be the same as before.
-	The values in db_encryption_key in Paasta-controller.yml must be the same when installing Paasta-4.0.
-	It should be recovered from installed paasta-4.0 . (app, user should not be present)
-	During recovery, follow the procedure below.

### <div id='12'/>2.3.2.	blob-store recovery

Log in to bosh cli and execute the command below.
```
$ bosh -e {director_name} -d paasta scp {blob_file_path}/blobstore.tar singleton-blobstore:/tmp   #blob file upload

$ bosh -e {director_name}  -d paasta ssh singleton-blobstore  #Access blobstore vm
$ sudo su - 
$ cd /tmp/
$ mv blobstore.tar /var/vcap/store
$ cd /var/vcap/store
$ rm -rf shared/cc-buildpacks/
$ tar xvf blobstore.tar
$ cd shared

$ mv xx.xxx.xx.xx.xip.io-cc-buildpacks/ cc-buildpacks   (Change Directory Name)
$ mv xx.xxx.xx.xx.xip.io-cc-resources cc-resources
$ mv xx.xxx.xx.xx.xip.io-cc-packages cc-packages
$ mv xx.xxx.xx.xx.xip.io-cc-droplets cc-droplets
$ exit
$ exit    # Exit from blobstore vm=
```

### <div id='13'/>2.3.3.	uaa database recovery
The uaa stores user information and authentication information.

```
$ bosh -e {director_name} -d paasta ssh database  #database vm Access
$ cd /var/vcap/packages/postgres-x.x.x/bin/
$ ./psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5524 -U uaa -W uaa (password is uaa_database_password set during paasta deployment)

Database login
# delete from external_group_mapping;
# delete from groups;
# delete from group_membership;
# delete from oauth_client_details;
# delete from users where username = 'admin';


Execute the contents in the modified uaadb-data.sql.
#  \q  (postgres exit)

$ exit 
$ exit
```

### <div id='14'/>2.3.4.	cloud_controller database recovery

```
$ bosh -d paasta ssh database
$ cd /var/vcap/packages/postgres-x.x.x/bin/
$ ./psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5524 -U cloud_controller -W cloud_controller (password is cc_database_password set during paasta deployment )

Database login
# delete from buildpacks;
# delete from clock_jobs;
# delete from domains;
# delete from isolation_segments;
# delete from env_groups; 
# delete from lockings;
# delete from spaces;
# delete from organizations;
# delete from quota_definitions;
# delete from stacks;
# delete from users;
# delete from security_groups;

# Execute the contents in the modified ccdb-data.sql.
#  \q  (postgres exit)
$ exit
