# <div id='1'/>1.  Document Outline

## <div id='2'/>1.1.  Purpose
This document (installation guide) is for upgrading pasta from version 3.1 or lower to version 4.0.

## <div id='3'/>1.2.  Range
This document (installation guide) guides you on how to upgrade pasta from version 3.1 or lower to version 4.0.


# <div id='4'/>2. K-PaaS 4.0 version upgrade
In K-PaaS AP 4.0, the distribution method and version upgrade method changed with versions prior to 3.1. Until K-PaaS AP 3.1, the version was upgraded based on the CF-release. However, with cf-release 287, cloud-foundry's bosh and cf deployment methods have changed.
Bosh deployed bosh based on bosh-deployment, and cloud-foundry deployed cf based on cf-deployment. CLI also changed from bosh-cli1 to bosh-cli2. In Bosh-cli2, the existing Bosh-cli command was also changed.

For this reason, upgrading from K-PaaS AP-3.1 to 4.0 is not possible with the existing method. The purpose of this guide is to migrate existing apps and user/organization information when upgrading from K-PaaS AP-3.1 to 4.0.

In order to migrate to K-PaaS AP 4.0, ccdb, uaadb, and blobstore data must be bakcuped and restored.

## <div id='5'/>2.1.	pre-requsite

1.	There should be no user using K-PaaS during Backup and Restore.
2.	3.1 and 4.0 shall have the same System domain.
3.	cf_admin_password must be the same as version 3.1.
4.	The Value in db_encryption_key at K-PaaS AP-3.1 K-PaaS AP-controller.yml should be the same when installing K-PaaS AP-4.0. 
5.	For K-PaaS AP-3.1 backup, the bosh cli standard is bosh1, and the K-PaaS AP-4.0 recovery bosh cli standard is bosh2.


### <div id='6'/>2.2.	K-PaaS AP-3.1 backup

Back up database data and blobstore data on the installed vm of K-PaaS AP-3.1


### <div id='7'/>2.2.1.	ccdb, uaadb backup (bosh cli 1 based)

```
$ bosh ssh postgres_z1/0   #postgres database vm access
$ sudo su –
$ cd /var/vcap/packages/postgres_x.x.x/bin/
$ ./pg_dump -U ccadmin -p 5524 -d ccdb --data-only --column-inserts > /tmp/ccdb-data.sql     # ccdb database backup (user, organizaion, spacae, app meta data)
./pg_dump -U uaaadmin -p 5524 -d uaadb --data-only --column-inserts > /tmp/uaadb-data.sql    # uaadb database backup (User Information meta data)

$ exit
$ exit   # comes from postgres vm.

$ bosh scp postgres_z1/0 --download  /tmp/ccdb-data.sql  {download_path}
$ bosh scp postgres_z1/0 --download  /tmp/uaadb-data.sql  {download_path}
$ cd {download_path}
$ mv ccdb-data.sql.postgres_z1.0 ccdb-data.sql
$ mv uaadb-data.sql.postgres_z1.0 uaadb-data.sql

```
### <div id='8'/>2.2.2.	blobstore backup

```
$ bosh ssh blobstore_z1/0   #blobstore_z1 vm Access
$ sudo su -
$ cd /var/vcap/store  
$ sudo tar cvf blobstore.tar shared/
$ sudo mv blobstore.tar /tmp/

$ exit
$ exit   # comes from blobstore vm

$ bosh scp blobstore_z1/0 /tmp/blobstore.tar {download_path} –download  (Time consuming depending on app capacity)

$ mv blobstore.tar.blobstore_z1.o blobstore.tar
```

### <div id='9'/>2.2.3.	ccdb, uaadb datafile edit


1)	Open uaadb-data.sql File
Delete Sentence : identity_zone, identity_provider, schema_migrations Table insert

2)	Open ccdb-data.sql File
Delete Sentence : schema_migrations Table insert



## <div id='10'/>2.3.	K-PaaS AP-4.0 restore (bosh2 cli Based)

### <div id='11'/>2.3.1.	pre-requisite

-	The bosh cli used in recover is bosh2
-	K-PaaS AP-4.0 should have been installed.
-	The system domain must be the same as before.
-	Cf_admin_password must be the same as before.
-	The values in db_encryption_key in Paasta-controller.yml must be the same when installing K-PaaS AP-4.0.
-	It should be recovered from installed K-PaaS AP-4.0 . (app, user should not be present)
-	During recovery, follow the procedure below.

### <div id='12'/>2.3.2.	blob-store recovery

Log in to bosh cli and execute the command below.
```
$ bosh -e {director_name} -d paasta scp {blob_file_path}/blobstore.tar singleton-blobstore:/tmp   #blob file upload

$ bosh -e {director_name}  -d paasta ssh singleton-blobstore  #Access blobstore vm
$ sudo su - 
$ cd /tmp/
$ mv blobstore.tar /var/vcap/store
$ cd /var/vcap/store
$ rm -rf shared/cc-buildpacks/
$ tar xvf blobstore.tar
$ cd shared

$ mv xx.xxx.xx.xx.xip.io-cc-buildpacks/ cc-buildpacks   (Change Directory Name)
$ mv xx.xxx.xx.xx.xip.io-cc-resources cc-resources
$ mv xx.xxx.xx.xx.xip.io-cc-packages cc-packages
$ mv xx.xxx.xx.xx.xip.io-cc-droplets cc-droplets
$ exit
$ exit    # Exit from blobstore vm=
```

### <div id='13'/>2.3.3.	uaa database recovery
The uaa stores user information and authentication information.

```
$ bosh -e {director_name} -d paasta ssh database  #database vm Access
$ cd /var/vcap/packages/postgres-x.x.x/bin/
$ ./psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5524 -U uaa -W uaa (password is uaa_database_password set during PaaS-TA deployment)

Database login
# delete from external_group_mapping;
# delete from groups;
# delete from group_membership;
# delete from oauth_client_details;
# delete from users where username = 'admin';


Execute the contents in the modified uaadb-data.sql.
#  \q  (postgres exit)

$ exit 
$ exit
```

### <div id='14'/>2.3.4.	cloud_controller database recovery

```
$ bosh -d paasta ssh database
$ cd /var/vcap/packages/postgres-x.x.x/bin/
$ ./psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5524 -U cloud_controller -W cloud_controller (password is cc_database_password set during PaaS-TA deployment )

Database login
# delete from buildpacks;
# delete from clock_jobs;
# delete from domains;
# delete from isolation_segments;
# delete from env_groups; 
# delete from lockings;
# delete from spaces;
# delete from organizations;
# delete from quota_definitions;
# delete from stacks;
# delete from users;
# delete from security_groups;

# Execute the contents in the modified ccdb-data.sql.
