## <div id='1'> 1. Document Outline
### <div id='1.1'> 1.1. Purpose

This document (Pinpoint Service Pack Installation Guide) describes how to install Pinpoint Service Pack, a service pack provided by PaaS-TA, using Bosch.

### <div id='1.2'> 1.2. Range
The installation Range was prepared based on the basic installation to verify the Pinpoint service pack.


### <div id='1.3'> 1.3. References
BOSH Document: [http://bosh.io](http://bosh.io)  
Cloud Foundry Document: [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org)  

## <div id='2'> 2. Pinpoint Service Installation

### <div id="2.1"/> 2.1. Prerequisite  

This installation guide is based on installing in a Linux environment.  
To install the service pack, BOSH CLI v2 must be installed and logged in to BOSH.  
If BOSH CLI v2 is not installed, you should first refer to the BOSH 2.0 installation guide document to install BOSH CLI v2 and familiarize the usage.  

- Check the bosh runtime-config to see if there are pinpoints in the bosh-dns include deployments.  
 â€» (Note) If there is no pinpoint in bosh-dns include deployments, open the dns.yml in ~/workspace/paasta-deployment/bosh/runtime-configs to add pinpoint and update the bosh runtime-config.   

> $ bosh -e micro-bosh runtime-config
```

### <div id="2.2"/> 2.2. Stemcell Check

Check the Stemcell list to make sure that the Stemcell required for service installation is uploaded.
The Stemcell of this guide uses ubuntu-bionic 1.76.  

> $ bosh -e ${BOSH_ENVIRONMENT} stemcells

```
Using environment '10.0.1.6' as client 'admin'

Name                                       Version   OS             CPI  CID

```

If the corresponding Stemcell is not uploaded, copy the Stemcell link to the corresponding IaaS environment and version from [bosh.io Stemcell](https://bosh.io/stemcells/) and run the following command.

```
# Example of Stemcell Upload Command
$ bosh -e ${BOSH_ENVIRONMENT} upload-stemcell -n {STEMCELL_URL}
```


### <div id="2.3"/> 2.3. Deployment Download  

Download the deployment needed from Git Repository and place the file in the service installation directory.  

- Service Deployment Git Repository URL : https://github.com/PaaS-TA/service-deployment/tree/v5.1.6

```
# Deployment File Download, make directory, change directory
$ mkdir -p ~/workspace
$ cd ~/workspace

# Deployment File Download
$ git clone https://github.com/PaaS-TA/service-deployment.git -b v5.1.6
```

### <div id="2.4"/> 2.4. Deployment File Modification

The BOSH Deployment manifest is a YAML file that defines the properties of components elements and deployments.  
Cloud config is used for network, vm_type, and disk_type used in Deployment files, and refer to the PaaS-TA AP installation guide for the usage.  

- Check the Cloud config settings.   

> $ bosh -e micro-bosh cloud-config   

```

##  <div id='3'> 3. Sample Web App Interworking Pinpoint

This Sample Web App is deployed on an open cloud platform and Pinpoint's service can be used with Provision and Bind.

### <div id='3.1'> 3.1. Pinpoint Service Broker Registration

When the Pinpoint service pack deployment is completed, the Pinpoint service broker must be registered first to use the service pack in the application.  
When registering a service broker, you must be logged in as a user who can register a service broker in PaaS-TA.

- Check the list of service brokers.

> $ cf service-brokers
```
Getting service brokers as admin...

name   url
No service brokers found
```

- Service Broker Registration Commands
```
cf create-service-broker [SERVICE_BROKER] [USERNAME] [PASSWORD] [SERVICE_BROKER_URL]

[SERVICE_BROKER] : Service Broker Name
[USERNAME] / [PASSWORD] : User ID / PASSWORD with access to service broker
[SERVICE_BROKER_URL] : Service Broker Access URL
```

- Register Pinpoint Service Broker.

> $ cf create-service-broker pinpoint-service-broker admin cloudfoundry http://<broker_ip>:8080

```
$ cf create-service-broker pinpoint-service-broker admin cloudfoundry http://10.30.107.182:8080
Creating service broker pinpoint-service-broker as admin...
OK
```

-   Check the registered Pinpoint service broker.

> $ cf service-brokers
```
Getting service brokers as admin...
name url
pinpoint-service-broker http://10.30.107.182:8080
```

-   Check the list of accessible services.

> $ cf service-access
```
Getting service access as admin...
broker: pinpoint-service-broker
   offering   plan                access   orgs
   Pinpoint   Pinpoint_standard   none  
```
Access is not allowed by default when creating a service broker.

- Assign permission to a specific organization to access the service and recheck the access service list. (Overall Organization)

> $ cf enable-service-access Pinpoint
```
Enabling access to all plans of service Pinpoint for all orgs as admin...
OK
```

- Check the permission to access the service.
> $ cf service-access

   Pinpoint   Pinpoint_standard   all  
```

### <div id='3.2'> 3.2. Sample Web App Download

The Sample Web App is deployed as an App to PaaS-TA. Initial data is generated through Pinpoint service Bind on the deployed app.  
After the binding is completed, Pinpoint service monitoring for the app can be performed through the browser through the connection url.

- Download Zip File of Sample Apps 
```
$ wget https://nextcloud.paas-ta.org/index.php/s/NDgriPk5cgeLMfG/download --content-disposition  
$ unzip paasta-service-samples.zip  
$ cd paasta-service-samples/pinpoint  
```

<br>

### <div id='3.3'> 3.3. Request for service in PaaS-TA

To use the Pinpoint service in the Sample Web App, you must request for a service (Provision).  
*Note: When requesting for a service, you must be logged in as a user who can request for a service in PaaS-TA.  

- check whether there is a service in the PaaS-TA Marketplace first.

> $ cf marketplace

```
Getting services from marketplace in org org / space space as admin...
OK

service    plans               description
Pinpoint   Pinpoint_standard   A simple pinpoint implementation
```

- Command for requesting Service Instance
```
cf create-service [SERVICE] [PLAN] [SERVICE_INSTANCE]

[SERVICE] : Service nName shown in the Marketplace
[PLAN] : Policies for Services
[SERVICE_INSTANCE] : Name of the service instance to create
```

- If there is a service that you want in the Marketplace, create a service instance by requesting for a service (Provision).

> $ cf create-service Pinpoint Pinpoint_standard PS1

```
Creating service instance PS1 in org org / space space as admin...
OK
```

- Check the generated Pinpoint service instance.

> $ cf services
```
Getting services in org system / space space as admin...
OK

name   service      plan                 bound apps   last
PS1    Pinpoint     Pinpoint_standard                 create succeeded
```

### <div id='3.4'> 3.4. Request for service bind to Sample Web App and check for App

When the service application is completed, the Sample Web App binds the generated service instance and uses the Pinpoint service in the App.  
*Note: When requesting for service bind, you must be logged in as a user who can request for service bind on the PaaS-TA platform.

- Check manifest fie.
