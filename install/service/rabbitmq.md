## <div id='1'> 1. Document Outline
### <div id='1.1'> 1.1. Purpose
This document (Rabbit MQ service pack installation guide) describes how to install RabbitMQ service pack, which is a service pack provided by K-PaaS, using Bosh. 

### <div id='1.2'> 1.2. Range
The installation range was prepared based on the basic installation to verify the RabbitMQ service pack. 


### <div id='1.3'> 1.3. References
BOSH Document: [http://bosh.io](http://bosh.io)  
Cloud Foundry Document: [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org)  


## <div id='2'> 2. RabbitMQ Service Installation

### <div id="2.1"/> 2.1. Prerequisite  

This installation guide is based on installing in a Linux environment. 
In order to install the service pack, BOSH CLI v2 must be installed and logged in to BOSH.
If BOSH CLI v2 is not installed, you should first refer to the BOSH 2.0 installation guide document to install BOSH CLI v2 and familiarize the usage.

- Check the bosh runtime-config to see if there is a rabbitmq in the bosh-dns include deployments.
 â€» (Note) If bosh-dns include deployments is not at rabbitmq, go to ~/workspace/ap-deployment/bosh/runtime-configs and open dns.yml to add rabbitmq and update bosh runtime-config.  

> $ bosh -e micro-bosh runtime-config
```

### <div id="2.2"/> 2.2. Stemcell Check

Check the Stemcell list to make sure that the Stemcell required for service installation is uploaded.
The Stemcell of this guide uses ubuntu-jammy 1.181.

> $ bosh -e ${BOSH_ENVIRONMENT} stemcells

```
Using environment '10.0.1.6' as client 'admin'

```

If the corresponding Stemcell is not uploaded, copy the Stemcell link to the corresponding IaaS environment and version from [bosh.io Stemcell](https://bosh.io/stemcells/) and run the following command.

```
# Example of Stemcell Upload Command
$ bosh -e ${BOSH_ENVIRONMENT} upload-stemcell -n {STEMCELL_URL}
```

### <div id="2.3"/> 2.3. Deployment Download  

Download the deployment needed from Git Repository and place the file at the service installation directory 

- Service Deployment Git Repository URL : https://github.com/K-PaaS/service-deployment/tree/v5.1.25.1

```
# Deployment File Download , make directory, change directory
$ mkdir -p ~/workspace
$ cd ~/workspace

# Deployment File Download
$ git clone https://github.com/K-PaaS/service-deployment.git -b v5.1.25.1

# common_vars.yml File Download (Download if common_vars.yml doesn't exist)
$ git clone https://github.com/K-PaaS/common.git
```

### <div id="2.4"/> 2.4. Deployment File Modification

The BOSH Deployment manifest is a YAML file that defines the properties of components elements and deployments. 
Cloud config is used for network, vm_type, and disk_type used in Deployment files, and refer to the K-PaaS AP installation guide on the usage.  

- Check the Cloud config settings.  

> $ bosh -e micro-bosh cloud-config

## <div id='3'> 3. Description for Sample App including RabbitMQ Linkage

This Sample App is deployed to K-PaaS AP and can be used with RabbitMQ's service on Provision and Bind.

### <div id='3.1'> 3.1. Service Broker Registration

When the RabbitMQ service pack deployment is completed, you must first register the RabbitMQ service broker to use the service pack in the application.
When registering a service broker, you must log in as a user who can register a service broker in K-PaaS AP.

- Check the list of service brokers.
> $ cf service-brokers
```
Getting service brokers as admin...

No service brokers found
```

<br>

- Command for registering Service Broker
```
cf create-service-broker [SERVICE_BROKER] [USERNAME] [PASSWORD] [SERVICE_BROKER_URL]

[SERVICE_BROKER] : Service Broker Name
[USERNAME] / [PASSWORD] : User ID / PASSWORD with access to service broker
[SERVICE_BROKER_URL] : Service Broker Access URL
```
	
- Register RabbitMQ service broker.

> $ cf create-service-broker rabbitmq-service-broker admin cloudfoundry http://<rmq-broker_ip>:4567
```
$ cf create-service-broker rabbitmq-service-broker admin cloudfoundry http://10.30.107.191:4567
Creating service broker rabbitmq-service-broker as admin...
OK

```
<br>

- Check the registered RabbitMQ service broker.

> $ cf service-brokers  

```
Getting service brokers as admin...

name                    url
rabbitmq-service-broker http://10.30.107.191:4567
```
<br>

- Check the list of accessible services.

> $ cf service-access

```
Getting service access as admin...
broker: rabbitmq-service-broker
   offering   plan       access   orgs
   rabbitmq   standard   none          
```

- Access is initially not permitted when registering as a service broker. Therefore, access is set to none.

- Assign permission to a specific organization to access the service and recheck the access service list. (Overall Organization)

> $ cf enable-service-access rabbitmq 

```
Enabling access to all plans of service offering rabbitmq for all orgs as admin...
OK
```

> $ cf service-access
```
Getting service access as admin...

   rabbitmq   standard   all               
```

### <div id='3.2'> 3.2. Sample App Download

- Download Zip file of Sample Apps
```
$ wget https://nextcloud.k-paas.org/index.php/s/scFDGk9iZBg8apZ/download --content-disposition  
$ unzip ap-service-samples-db49d1e.zip  
$ cd ap-service-samples/rabbitmq  
```

<br>


### <div id='3.3'> 3.3. Request for service
Request for service in order to use the RabbitMQ service in the Sample App, you must request for service (Provision).
*Note: When requesting for a service, you must be logged in as a user who can request for a service in K-PaaS AP.

- Check whether there is a service in the K-PaaS AP Marketplace first.

> $ cf marketplace

```
Getting all service offerings from marketplace in org system / space dev as admin...

offering   plans          description                                                                                                                   broker
rabbitmq   standard       RabbitMQ service to provide shared instances of this high-performance multi-protocol messaging broker.                        rabbitmq-service-broker

TIP: Use 'cf marketplace -e SERVICE_OFFERING' to view descriptions of individual plans of a given service offering.
```
<br>

- Command for Service Instance Request
```
cf create-service [SERVICE] [PLAN] [SERVICE_INSTANCE]

[SERVICE] : Service name shown in the Marketplace
[PLAN] : Policies for Services
[SERVICE_INSTANCE] : Name of the service instance to create
```

- If there is a service you want on the Marketplace, request for a service (Provision).

> $ cf create-service rabbitmq standard my_rabbitmq_service
```
Creating service instance my_rabbitmq_service in org system / space dev as admin...
OK
```

<br>

- Check the generated instance of the RabbitMQ service.

> $ cf services

### <div id='3.4'> 3.4. Request for service bind to Sample App and check App
Once the service request is completed, download the labbit-example-app provided by cf and conduct the test.
* Note: When requesting for service bind, you must be logged in as a user who can request for service bind in K-PaaS AP.

- Check the manifest file.  

> $ vi manifest.yml
